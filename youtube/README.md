##Notes
### Note:
To search for content (videos, playlists or channels), use the Search available in Showtime's homepage.

### Note 2:
To search for a specific user to see its profile, use the Search available in Showtime writing
youtube:user:username:<username>, where <username> is the nickname used by that user to be identified by others.

### Note 3:
At the moment, Showtime can't play HTTP Live Streams like the ones that Youtube uses, but you can view the videos that were live streams and were processed. 
Currently Live Streams despite being shown there, they will give you error 400 while Showtime can't support these links.

## Information for programmers
### Opening a video
Starting version 2.2, the plugin supports a few more URI routes:
- youtube:video:<id>
- youtube:video:simple:<id>
- youtube:video:advanced:<id>

In all above, id is the ID of the video to watch.
The first URI route is recommended because that way the plugin will use user preferences and play the video immediately (simple mode) 
or show video details (advanced mode).

You can still use the old URI routes but they are now deprecated and subject to be removed in the future:
- youtube:video:simple:<title>:<id>
- youtube:video:advanced:<title>:<id>
