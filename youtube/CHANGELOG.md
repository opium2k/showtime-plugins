Note 1:
- In April of 2012, Youtube deprecated the ClientLogin way to authenticate way, due to that this version includes the newest authentication method, 
it totally different but works really well. A tutorial showing how to authenticate will be released next to the plugin release, it will feature 
screenshots that will help you understand the process.
- This method uses a computer with Internet connection to authorize the plugin, because of that, you don't need a keyboard to type anything in Showtime to login.
- Additionaly, OAuth2 provides extra security since it doesn't save the actual credentials in HDD, only an access_token (temporary) and a refresh_token 
(to get a new access_token), no passwords involved.
